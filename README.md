# paintjs
Simple paint app made with vanilla JS. 

How to Use
--------------------------
* Use the slider to adjust brush size (left for smaller brush size, right for larger brush size).
* Select the "Fill" button and click anywhere on the canvas to fill the background with a specified color. Click the same button to resume drawing (will be titled "paint" when currently in fill mode and "fill when currently in paint mode").
* Click the save button to save the canvas to downloads.

! Dimension sensitive !
--------------------------
* For best results, start and end painting on same dimensions, or there will be an offset between the cursor and where the painting is being done. 

* Refresh the browser if dimensions are changed to prevent offset between canvas and cursor
